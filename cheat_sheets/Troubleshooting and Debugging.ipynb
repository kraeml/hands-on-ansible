    "Debug is often used in conjunction with 'register' to help you figure out what's going on.\n",

    "## Common Playbook Problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of your errors will come from incorrect YAML syntax. The most common errors to check for are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Not quoting an argument that starts with a variable, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "    vars:\n",
    "      age_path: {{ dave.age }}/html/oldman.html\n",
    "\n",
    "If you start a value with a variable, you'll need to quote the whole thing:\n",
    "\n",
    "    vars:\n",
    "      age_path: \"{{ dave.age }}/html/oldman.html\"\n",
    "\n",
    "See the YAML cheatsheet for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Incorrect Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll often have a task, block, or conditional that's indented one tab too many, or not indented enough. Ansible's error messages are getting better at narrowing down the errors and giving you a specific location to check, but this can still be wonky.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you're using consistent indentation!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
